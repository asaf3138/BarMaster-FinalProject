## 📌 Overview

Bar Master is a complete bar management desktop system developed as a final project in a software engineering program.

The system provides an intuitive interface for managing customers, cocktails, inventory, sales, and user permissions. Built with C# using Windows Forms and SQL Server, it integrates Guna UI to deliver a modern and responsive user experience.

The main goal was to create a simple, efficient, and expandable solution for small to medium-sized bars, allowing full control of operations under one unified platform. Key system elements include:

- Customer tracking with status levels (Silver / Gold / Platinum)
- Cocktail management and preview
- Inventory and shortage alerts
- Purchase flow with discounts
- Graph-based sales and revenue analysis
- Role-based access for bartenders, waiters, and managers

Bar Master was developed following best practices in OOP, UI/UX design, and secure data handling (e.g., SHA256 password hashing).
